title: "To SQL or not to SQL"
---

In the Shakespearian play, one can find the cliche quote, "To RDBM, or no SQL? That is the question". Perhaps he was one of the pioneers of computer science post Ada Lovelace; a genius mind never to be appreciated. Poor William.

However, it is nearing the end of 2019 and we must attempt to begin to understand the question. You might be asking yourself,
where do I begin? What does all this mean? Why do I need to know? 

First things first. 

What does all this mean, you say? Well, it's most important to begin with the basics. What is an RDBM? 

<em>A type of database that uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database - [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rdbms-sql)</em>

A real world, down-to-earth explanation:

Say we want information for a particular school in the neighborhood in the ABC School District. First, we can go to the school district website or wherever you prefer to get the information. This will contain information on all of the schools. We can further dig into individual school information and so on. Therefore, a school is related to a school district. The information for the school is related to the ABC School District information.

Second things second.

What is a noSQL database?

There are a few definitions here. Perhaps the most common are the following: 

    1. document databases
    2. graph stores
    3. key-value stores
    4. wide-column stores

<em>[check out this article on the mongoDB website for a more in depth explanation on the various types mentioned](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)</em>

NoSQL databases are becoming increasingly common due to the agile boom and many people looking to modernize legacy systems. Often, these databases tend to be more flexible, higher performing, and able to handle quick changes along with frequent deployments. 

So, which should you learn and use? Learn both and use your new found knowledge to make the decision best suited for your project.

Happy databasing my friends
